# AHID
Hardware based, AI assisted, Automated Human Input Device using a Raspberry Pi Zero and the USB Gadget Kernel module.

Using the Media API in Firefox to capture windows, and the Linux Gadget Kernel module, we can off load task from the host CPU to an external device; think Game Shark. As cheats get more complex so do the client side anti-cheats, leading to a race to ring zero. This prevents most anti-cheats from being able to detect any malfeasance.


# Use Cases
  - Undetectable cheats; e.g. aimbot, auto farming, etc.
  - Mimic repetative user interaction.
